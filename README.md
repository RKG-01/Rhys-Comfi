# Rhys-Comfi
My version of @Comfy-Themes Comfy for the Spicetify Client.

Simply drag and drop the 'Comfi' into \AppData\Roaming\spicetify\Themes then do "spicetify config current_theme Comfi" in Powershell.
I have (somewhat) made a theme for Comfi, use "spicetify config color_scheme Rhys" to apply.
