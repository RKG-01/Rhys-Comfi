# Rhys' Comfi
My version of @Comfy-Themes Comfy for the Spicetify Client.

- Simply drag and drop the 'Comfi' into \AppData\Roaming\spicetify\Themes then do "spicetify config current_theme Comfi" in Powershell.
  You should not do anything with 'README.md'. Only download & use Comfi!
- I have (somewhat) made a theme for Comfi, use "spicetify config color_scheme Rhys" to apply it.
- Finally, use "Spicetify Apply" to apply Comfi.
